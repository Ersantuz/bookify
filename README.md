        - <span style="color:#df7861;"> Terracotta</span>, used to make content stand out.
        - <span style="color:#94b49f;"> Summer Green</span>, to add some color.

        -   The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason Montserrat isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a font used frequently for printed material, such as brochures, signage and even books; so it is both attractive and appropriate.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the team behind the project.

    1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a clear and breaf description of the website purpose with a "Start Reading" call to action button.
    1. The user has two options, navigate the website through a clear navigation bar or using the call to action buttons accessible by the home page. Both choice will lead to the same results.

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    As a Frequent Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content I am interested to learn or read about.

    1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
    1. The website is designed to allow the user to easily navigate the books' catalouge in order to always be able to find her reading choice. It is furthermore built to navigate through book choices by genre and mood, so as to guide the user in her next book selection. A book description can be found for every book, such to provide all the relevant information to the user in order to pick her next reading from the library. 

### Further Testing

-   The website was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox and Safari.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPad Air, iPad Mini, iPhone SE, iPhone XR.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

-   The epub.js library is unstable in loading the book. Sometimes it needs to reload the page in order to access the book. I still haven't found the reason behind such occurrences.

### Further Developments

-   Further developments will be directed in the expansion of the book catalouge, genres and moods. Moreover, the website will provide the user with bookmark functionality, page detector and percentage of page read of a book. It will moreover provide statistics of reading time for the user.

-   The database will be moved from Javascript to sql.
